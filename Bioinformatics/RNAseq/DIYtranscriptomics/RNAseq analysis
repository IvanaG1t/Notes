conda activate rnaseq
# enter the folder where reference.fasta is held
kallisto -i Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cdna.all.idx Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cdna.all.fa
# this generates an indexed reference file called "Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cdna.all.idx"
# alternatively, download premade kallisto references
kallisto quant -i homo_sapiens/transcriptome.idx -o test -t 6 --single -l 250 -s 30 SRR8668755_1M_subsample.fastq.gz &>test.log
# this will map your data (SRR8668755_1M_subsample.fastq.gz in this case) against the generated index file
# -o is for output in "test folder"
# -t is for multithreading with 6 threads in this case. This number depends on your hardware. The more threads you use, the faster the mapping will be done.
# -l is for read leanght, telling the software that all reads are 250 bp long
# -s is for SD of read leanght, so it will take up 250+/-30 bs long reads and discard the rest as junk
